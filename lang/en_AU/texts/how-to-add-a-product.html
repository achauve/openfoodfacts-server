<h1>How can I add a product?</h1>

<p>Open Food Facts is a collaborative project where each citizen can contribute by adding or completing product information.</p>

<p>We try to offer the most user-friendly interface to make it easy and fast to add products. Here are some images with each stage involve in adding a product (with a few tricks to go faster.)</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>Register on Open Food Facts and login</h3></li>

<p>If you haven't registered yet, you can register <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/user.pl">here</a> in 30 seconds</p>

<li><h3>Take pictures of the product in the following order</h3></li>

<ol type="a">
<li>Barcode</li>
<li>Product main visual</li>
<li>Ingredients list</li>
<li>Nutritional composition</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tips to Take Pictures</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>Place the product on a white surface (a white sheet of paper for example) and take the picture vertically</li>
<li>Take pictures in portrait or landscape mode, you can crop them later on the website.</li>
<li>Respect the aspect ratio of the product.</li>
<li>Focus on the image to cut out the shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Do not edit the pictures in other software before sending them in. Pictures are to be edited directly on the website.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Add the product</h3></li>
<ol type="a">
<p>On the left pane of the webpage, you will find a section which looks like this:</p>
<img src="/images/misc/off-add-product.png" style="border:1px solid grey">

<li><h4>Click on the "Picture with barcode" button to upload a picture of your product with the barcode clearly visible</h4></li>

<p>The bar code will be recognized automatically if the picture is not too blurry and you will be redirected to the product page.
You can check the accuracy of the information.</p>
<p>If your pictures are better than the existing ones, do not hesitate to upload your own.</p>
<p>If the product does not exist, you will be provided with a form to enter the necessary information.</p>
<p><b>Note for Chrome and Firefox users:</b> The photo is automatically resized to a reasonable size, hence upload is fast even with a 20 million pixels camera.</p>

<li><h4>In the Product picture section, click on the "Add a picture" button to upload a product visual</h4></li>
<p> If you have already uploaded a picture which includes both the product visual and the bar code in the previous step, skip this step

<img src="/images/misc/off-product-pic.png" style="border:1px solid grey">

<li><h4>Rotate and crop the uploaded image if required</h4></li>
<p>Use the "Rotate left" and "Rotate right" to rotate the image</p>
<p>Click and drag over the image to crop it</p>
<p>If the picture has been taken on a white background, select the "Photo on white background: try to remove the background." This slightly grays out edges of the picture and enhances the colors. However, if you feel the colors are too saturated, you can keep the original picture.</p>

<li><h4>Click on the "Validate and/or resize image" button once you are done</h4></li>

<li><h4>In the Product Characteristics section, fill out the following fields:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Product name</li>
    <li>Common name</li>
    <li>Quantity</li>
    <li>Packaging</li>
    <li>Brands</li>
    <li>Categories</li>
    <li>Labels, certifications, awards</li>
    <li>Manufacturing or processing places</li>
    <li>EMB code</li>
    <li>Link to the product page on the official site of the producer</li>
    <li>Best before date</li>
    <li>City, state and country where purchased</li>
    <li>Stores</li>
    <li>Countries where sold</li>
</ul>

<p>Helper text is provided underneath the corresponding input field to help you understand what we need.</p>

<li><h4>In the Ingredients section, click on the "Add a picture" button to upload a picture of the list of ingredients</h4></li>


<li><h4>Crop the area containing the list of ingredients and click on the "Validate and/or resize image" button</h4></li>

<li><h4>Click on "Extract the ingredients from the picture" to automatically fill out the Ingredients list field</h4></li>
<p>Recognition works better when the picture is sharp and the text straight.</p>
<p>If the text is curved (picture of a can for example) or if the background is not uniform, the ingredients are not generally recognised.</p>

<li><h4>Correct the automatically extracted ingredients list</h4></li>
<p>The ingredients extraction feature is almost, but not completely accurate, so there can be tiny errors.</p>

<p>This automatic recognition will improve with time. The more products we have, the better the dictionary of ingredients generated to be of service to the text recognition algorithm.</p>

<li><h4>Fill out the remaining fields in the Ingredients section.</h4></li>

<ul>
    <li>Substances or products causing allergies or intolerances</li>
    <li>Traces</li>
    <li>Origin of ingredients</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is crucial and sometimes vital for allergy sufferers.</p>

<li><h4>In the Nutrition Facts section, click on the "Add a picture" button to upload a picture of the Nutrition Facts table given on the packaging</h4></li>

<p>If the nutrition facts have not specified on the product packaging, select the "Nutrition facts are not specified on the product" box.</p>

<li><h4>Crop the area containing the nutrition facts table and click on the "Validate and/or resize image" button</h4></li>

<p>Nutritional tables are more difficult to recognize than the ingredients list. Therefore, it has not been automated yet.</p>

<li><h4>Fill out the remaining fields in the Nutrition Facts section.</h4></li>

<p>Currently we provide a list of the most frequently listed nutrients with their common quantity unit. Fill out the quantities as specified in the table</p>

<p>The European legislation allows manufacturers to list other nutrients (vitamins and minerals in particular). If they are listed on the packaging, you can add them in the last line of the table. By typing the first few letters you will get a drop down list with the corresponding nutrients and the most common corresponding units (mg for vitamin C for example). If you can not find the nutrient, you can type it in full</p>
